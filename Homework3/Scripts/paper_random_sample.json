Furthermore, iron accumulation and oxidative stress have been shown to associate with the pathological progression of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease\u00a0(PD). In this review, the role of iron species in generating the most deleterious free radical species (ie, hydroxyl radical) and effects of this species in causing oxidative stress in vivo are described. The implications of oxidative stress and the recently recognized cell death pathway (ie, ferroptosis) to AD are addressed. Strategies to combat this neurodegenerative disease, such as iron chelation and antioxidant therapies, and future research directions on this aspect are also discussed.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": []}, "31800195": {"ArticleTitle": "[Alzheimer's disease therapy: challenges and perspectives.]", "AbstractText": "Here we review both clinically applied and newly emerging approaches for Alzheimer's disease management. Alzheimer's disease or Alzheimer's type dementia is the most common type of primary dementia affecting late and senile age. Hallmarks of the disorder include progressive memory loss and highest nervous activity disruption; these cause dramatic consequences to the psychological activity. The disease course is characterized by continuous (lasting years and decades) decline, increasing degree of disability, and eventual death. Despite long-lasting attempts, researchers and medical professionals were not able to elaborate effective treatment so far. The problem is tightly connected to elucidating of Alzheimer's disease molecular mechanisms as well as development of novel therapeutics and early diagnostics approaches.\u0412

progressively impairs cognitive functions. Computer-assisted diagnosis of AD based on image analysis is an emerging tool to support AD diagnosis. In this article, we explore the application of Supervised Switching Autoencoders (SSAs) to perform AD classification using only one structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) slice. SSAs are revised supervised autoencoder architectures, combining unsupervised representation and supervised classification as one unified model. In this work, we study the capabilities of SSAs to capture complex visual neurodegeneration patterns, and fuse disease semantics simultaneously. We also examine how regions associated to disease state can be discovered by SSAs following a local patch-based approach.Patch-based SSAs models are trained on individual patches extracted from a single 2D slice, independently for Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal anatomical planes of the brain at selected informative locations, exploring different patch sizes and network parameterizations. Then, models perform binary class prediction - healthy (CDR\u202f=\u202f0) or AD-demented (CDR\u202f>\u202f0) - on test data at patch level. The final subject classification is performed employing a majority rule from the ensemble of patch predictions. In addition, relevant regions are identified, by computing accuracy densities from patch-level predictions, and analyzed, supported by Atlas-based regional definitions.Our experiments employing a single 2D T1-w sMRI slice per subject show that SSAs perform similarly to previous proposals that rely on full volumetric information and feature-engineered representations. SSAs classification accuracy on slices extracted along the Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal anatomical planes from a balanced cohort of 40 independent test subjects was 87.5%, 90.0%, and 90.0%, respectively. A top sensitivity of 95.0% on both Coronal and Sagittal planes was also obtained.SSAs provided well-ranked accuracy performance among previous classification proposals, including feature-engineered and feature learning based methods, using only one scan slice per subject, instead of the whole 3D volume, as it is conventionally done. In addition, regions identified as relevant by SSAs' were, in most part, coherent or partially coherent in regard to relevant regions reported on previous works. These regions were also associated with findings from medical knowledge, which gives value to our methodology as a potential analytical aid for disease understanding.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Brain", "Female", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Supervised Machine Learning", "Young Adult"]}, "31896932": {"ArticleTitle": "Lipopolysaccharide Increases Cortical Kynurenic Acid and Deficits in Reference Memory in Mice.", "AbstractText": "Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a glial-derived metabolite of tryptophan metabolism, is an antagonist of the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the glycine-binding site of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Kynurenic acid levels are increased in both the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of several psychiatric disorders including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer disease. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines have been found to be elevated in the blood of schizophrenic patients suggesting inflammation may play a role in psychiatric illness. As both pro-inflammatory cytokines and KYNA can be elevated in the brain by peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, we therefore sought to characterize the role of neuroinflammation on learning and memory using a well-described dual-LPS injection model. Mice were injected with an initial injection (0.25\u2009mg/kg LPS, 0.50\u2009mg/kg, or saline) of LPS and then administrated a second injection 16\u2009hours later. Our results indicate both 0.25 and 0.50\u2009mg/kg dual-LPS treatment increased l-kynurenine and KYNA levels in the medial pre-frontal cortex (mPFC).

With a multi-site linear probe, we recorded local field potentials simultaneously at the posterior-parietal cortex and hippocampus of wild-type and double transgenic AD mice, under anesthesia. We focused on PS2APP (B6.152H) mice carrying both presenilin-2 (PS2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutations, at three and six months of age, before and after plaque deposition respectively. To highlight defects linked to either the PS2 or APP mutation, we included in the analysis age-matched PS2.30H and APP-Swedish mice, carrying each of the mutations individually. Our study also included PSEN2-/- mice. At three months, only predeposition B6.152H mice show a reduction in the functional connectivity of slow oscillations (SO) and in the power ratio between SO and delta waves. At six months, plaque-seeding B6.152H mice undergo a worsening of the low/high frequency power imbalance and show a massive loss of cortico-hippocampal phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between SO and higher frequencies, a feature shared with amyloid-free PS2.30H mice.

Glioblastoma is a prime example of such difficult-to-treat, invasive, and incurable malignancies. With the advent of the post-genomic age and increased access to next-generation sequencing technologies, numerous publications have described the presence and extent of intratumoural and intertumoural heterogeneity present in glioblastoma. Moreover, there have been numerous reports more directly correlating the heterogeneity of glioblastoma to its refractory, reoccurring, and inevitably terminal nature. It is therefore prudent to consider the different forms of heterogeneity seen in glioblastoma and how to harness this understanding to better strategize novel therapeutic approaches. One of the most central questions of tumour heterogeneity is how these numerous different cell types (both tumour and non-tumour) in the tumour mass communicate.This chapter provides a brief review on the variable heterogeneity of glioblastoma, with a focus on cellular heterogeneity and on modalities of communication that can induce further molecular diversity within the complex and ever-evolving tumour microenvironment. We provide particular emphasis on the emerging role of actin-based cellular conduits called tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs) and tumour microtubes (TMs) and outline the perceived current problems in the field that need to be resolved before pharmacological targeting of TNTs can become a reality.We conclude that TNTs and TMs provide a new and exciting avenue for the therapeutic targeting of glioblastoma and that numerous inroads have already made into TNT and TM biology.

Notably, when irradiated with an 808 nm laser, the agent demonstrates the high efficacy of photothermal therapy and heat release efficiency of the drug around the tumor site. This combination therapy provides an alternative drug administration method and can be adapted to a series of cancer cell types and molecular targets associated with disease progression.", "Query": "cancer", "Mesh": ["Drug Delivery Systems", "Humans", "Hyperthermia, Induced", "Metal-Organic Frameworks", "Phototherapy", "Precision Medicine"]}, "32490210": {"ArticleTitle": "Gene expression of Epithelial Membrane Protein 2 gene and \u03b21-Integrin gene in patients with breast cancer.", "AbstractText": "Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women. The function of over a thousand genes is reported as affected by genetic modifications in breast cancer.To study the gene expression of Epithelial Membrane 2 (EMP2) and \u03b21-Integrin genes in patients with breast cancer.This study was carried out by cooperation between the Biochemistry Division Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Menoufia University. This study included 120 subjects divided into 2 groups Group I: Included 60 women with breast cancer undergoing modified radical mastectomy. Tissue specimens were taken from the cancerous breast tissue and from the marginal healthy breast tissues. Group II: Included 60 age and sex-matched apparently healthy women served as a control group. All patients participants were subjected to full history taking, general clinical examination, abdominal ultrasound, CT-scan for abdomen, mammography, fine needle biopsy, histopathological examination, immunostaining of tissues, metastatic work up (chest x-ray and bone scan) and laboratory investigations including: Complete blood count (patients and controls), serum carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (patients and controls), detection of EMP2 and \u03b21-Integrin genes expression in the tissue samples by formation of cDNA by reverse transcription PCR after RNA extraction and real-time PCR using SYBR Green technique.Compared to healthy tissues, the breast cancer tissues had significant higher EMP2 and \u03b21-Integringene expression levels. Also, there was a significant increase in CA15-3 in patients group as compared with the control group. It was found that EMP2 and \u03b21-Integrin expression in malignant tissue samples correlates with advanced and metastatic disease.The gene expression of EMP2 and \u03b21-Integrin are important markers for the severity of breast cancer and they are good indicators of its prognosis.", "Query": "cancer", "Mesh": []}}
